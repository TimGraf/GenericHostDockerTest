# Generic Host Docker Test

Based on the links below.  Added another service through DI and referenced the configs for that service with DI as well.

[.NET Generic Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-2.2)

[ASP.NET Core Generic Host Sample](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/fundamentals/host/generic-host/samples/2.x/GenericHostSample)


The docker-compose and docker file are more suited to development work but a suitable production docker file wouldn't be difficult to create.

To run the service just run the following commands.

`docker-compose up`
